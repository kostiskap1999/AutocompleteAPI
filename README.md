# Ad challenge

This project aims for a simple form for housing ad creations, using an external api for autocomplete Area selection suggestions.

## The backend

The backend connects to a MySQL database, and the handling of the autocomplete suggestions happens in the backend, as well as two more database calls
about posting an ad and getting all ads.

## The frontend

The frontend connects only to the backend, and has two pages, one of which is the form itself, and another is a list of created ads.


## Setting up

To set up the database, backend and frontend, in terms of installing dependencies and uploading the schema to Workbench, navigate to the respective
folders `backend` and `frontend` and follow `README.md` instructions there.
